# Algorithmic Path Finder

An algorithmic pathfinding project that generates mazes and visualizes how different search algorithms find the shortest or possible path between a start and end point.

This project is designed to demonstrate and compare classical pathfinding and graph traversal algorithms in a maze-based environment.
